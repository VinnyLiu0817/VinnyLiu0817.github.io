Hi:wave:! this is Weijie, and you can also call me Vinny. I am currently a first-year PhD student at **The University of Hong Kong**, under the supervision of **[Prof. Edith C.H. Ngai](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~iotlab/EdithNgai.html).** I received the Bachelor and Master degree in Computer Technology in **Sun Yat-sen University** under the supervision of **[Prof. Xiaoxi Zhang](https://0xxz.github.io).** and **[Prof. Xu Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/xcsysu/home)**. My research strives to develop theoretical tools to shed light on the blackbox of deep learning, as well as addressing practical problems in deep learning/LLM implementations. 

Research interests
======
* Networked machine learning (federated learning, distributed machine learning)
* Machine learning theory (model generalization analysis, training convergence analysis)

Recently, I am also enthusiatic about the LLM implementation and applications. I am always open to discussion and collaboration, if you are interested in my research area and paper, you are very welcomed to drop me an [email](liuwj0817@connect.hku.hk).
